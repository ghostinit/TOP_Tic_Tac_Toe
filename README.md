# TIC TAC TOE

## From The Odin Project: Javascript Course

### Main Goals
- Use module pattern
- Use factory function pattern
- Clear separation of concern

### Project Reflections
I had a lot of fun making this.  I was able to implement keyframes for the first time to animate the box-shadow that depicts the winners of the game.

As well, there is only a single line of code executed from the global context.  All other functionality is contained in IIFEs or from an object factory.

Separation of concerns seems fairly well accomplished as well.
